# Turing machine simulator (Universal Turing Machine)
Here's the video showcase: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doZjLgQTMfw
Python implementation of a Turing machine simulator

## Status
- Currently working fine for deterministic Turing machines
- Non deterministic machine support with multiprocessing coming soon

Planned features:
- ~~Multiprocessing display and simulate~~
- ~~GUI~~
- Config menu
- Sound?

Challenges:
- Non-deterministic Turing machines with Multiprocessing
- Halting problem of Turing machine
